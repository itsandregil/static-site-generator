        <article><div><h1>Why I Like Running</h1><p>Running is one of those things I complain about <i>while</i> doing it and then immediately miss once I stop. This page is a small tribute to sweating, questionable life choices, and endorphins.</p><p><img src="/static-site-generator/images/morning-run.jpg" alt="A person running at sunrise"></img></p><h2>Why I Like Running</h2><p>Here are the <i>very serious</i> and <i>highly scientific</i> reasons why running has my heart:</p><ul><li>It’s socially acceptable to wear big-ass glasses and <i>all</i> kinds of tech wearables at the same time.</li><li>It lets me buy expensive running shoes without guilt (this is called <i>self-care</i>).</li><li>Problems feel smaller when I’m too tired to think about them.</li><li>The post-run shower feels like a luxury spa experience.</li></ul><h2>How I Got Into Running</h2><p>Running wasn’t love at first step. It was more like a slow, awkward friendship.</p><p>1. I started running to “do something different.” 3. I survived my first 10-minute run. 4. I accidentally signed up for a race. 5. Stockholm syndrome kicked in. 6. Now I run voluntarily.</p><h2>Favorite Places to Run</h2><p>Some places just make running better (or at least more tolerable):</p><ul><li>Parks with trees and shade</li><li>Anywhere with a good view that distracts me from my legs</li></ul><h2>Helpful & Fun Running Links</h2><p>Here are some app I either use or pretend to use responsibly:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a> – proof that I actually ran</li><li><a href="https://www.runna.com/">Runna</a> – how I do not injured myself</li></ul><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Running isn’t always easy, fun, or graceful — but that’s kind of the point. It’s just me, the road, my thoughts, and the promise of snacks afterward.</p><p><i>Now excuse me while I stretch and dramatically complain about my calves.</i></p><h2>Other Posts About Running</h2><p>Because apparently running once wasn’t enough:</p><ul><li><a href="/static-site-generator/blog/my-first-marathon">My First Marathon</a> — featuring questionable decisions, emotional damage, and a finish time under 4 hours.</li><li><a href="/static-site-generator/blog/the-delusion-world-majors">The Delusion: Running the World Marathon Majors</a> — where I confidently plan a sub-3 marathon despite all available evidence.</li></ul></div></article>
