# The Delusion: Running the World Marathon Majors

[< Back Home](/)

At some point during my running journey, I developed a perfectly reasonable idea:  
_What if I ran all six World Marathon Majors?_

This idea ignored facts, statistics, and basic realism.

> “The line between confidence and delusion is thin — and I cross it every time I check marathon qualifying times.”

## What Are the World Marathon Majors?

For context, the **World Marathon Majors** are:

- Tokyo
- Boston
- London
- Berlin
- Chicago
- New York City

Six iconic races.  
Six medals.  
One very questionable life goal.

## The Small Problem (a.k.a. Reality)

Some of these races require things like:

- A **sub-3 hour marathon**.
- Age-group qualifying times that laugh at my PR.
- Lottery odds similar to winning the actual lottery.
- International travel and financial irresponsibility.

None of this stopped me.

## Why I Think I Can Do This Anyway

Here is my completely logical reasoning:

- I ran one marathon already.
- It was under 4 hours (important detail).
- I _like_ running, which is basically talent.
- I once ran a very good half marathon.
- Training harder will obviously solve everything.
- I have watched many YouTube videos.

## The Sub-3 Fantasy

To be clear, a sub-3 marathon means:

- Running fast.
- Continuously.
- For **42.195 km**.
- Without falling apart after 30 km.

This has not happened yet, but mentally I am already there.

## Gear That Will Definitely Make Me Faster

Because improvement is mostly about buying things:

- Carbon-plated shoes (science).
- A watch with more metrics than I understand.
- Sunglasses that make me look aerodynamic.
- A training plan I swear I’ll follow perfectly.
- Confidence bordering on delusion.

## Final Thoughts

Will I ever run all six World Marathon Majors?

Who knows.  
But believing I _might_ is half the fun.

Until then, I will continue training, dreaming, and casually telling people  
“I’m thinking about going for a sub-3.”

No further questions.
