        <article><div><h1>The Delusion: Running the World Marathon Majors</h1><p><a href="/">< Back Home</a></p><p>At some point during my running journey, I developed a perfectly reasonable idea: <i>What if I ran all six World Marathon Majors?</i></p><p>This idea ignored facts, statistics, and basic realism.</p><blockquote>“The line between confidence and delusion is thin — and I cross it every time I check marathon qualifying times.”</blockquote><p><img src="/images/the-delusion-world-majors.jpg" alt="Elite runners"></img></p><h2>What Are the World Marathon Majors?</h2><p>For context, the <b>World Marathon Majors</b> are:</p><ul><li>Tokyo</li><li>Boston</li><li>London</li><li>Berlin</li><li>Chicago</li><li>New York City</li></ul><p>Six iconic races. Six medals. One very questionable life goal.</p><h2>The Small Problem (a.k.a. Reality)</h2><p>Some of these races require things like:</p><ul><li>A <b>sub-3 hour marathon</b>.</li><li>Age-group qualifying times that laugh at my PR.</li><li>Lottery odds similar to winning the actual lottery.</li><li>International travel and financial irresponsibility.</li></ul><p>None of this stopped me.</p><h2>Why I Think I Can Do This Anyway</h2><p>Here is my completely logical reasoning:</p><ul><li>I ran one marathon already.</li><li>It was under 4 hours (important detail).</li><li>I <i>like</i> running, which is basically talent.</li><li>I once ran a very good half marathon.</li><li>Training harder will obviously solve everything.</li><li>I have watched many YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2>The Sub-3 Fantasy</h2><p>To be clear, a sub-3 marathon means:</p><ul><li>Running fast.</li><li>Continuously.</li><li>For <b>42.195 km</b>.</li><li>Without falling apart after 30 km.</li></ul><p>This has not happened yet, but mentally I am already there.</p><h2>Gear That Will Definitely Make Me Faster</h2><p>Because improvement is mostly about buying things:</p><ul><li>Carbon-plated shoes (science).</li><li>A watch with more metrics than I understand.</li><li>Sunglasses that make me look aerodynamic.</li><li>A training plan I swear I’ll follow perfectly.</li><li>Confidence bordering on delusion.</li></ul><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Will I ever run all six World Marathon Majors?</p><p>Who knows. But believing I <i>might</i> is half the fun.</p><p>Until then, I will continue training, dreaming, and casually telling people “I’m thinking about going for a sub-3.”</p><p>No further questions.</p></div></article>
