# My First Marathon

[< Back Home](/)

Yes, I ran 42.195 km.  
Yes, I survived.  
And yes — I finished in **under 4 hours**, which I will mention casually whenever possible.

## Why I Signed Up for a Marathon

Several factors contributed to this decision, none of them rational:

- I said “sure” before fully understanding the distance.
- I thought _“how hard can it be?”_ (famous last words).
- Peer pressure, but like… sporty peer pressure.
- I wanted a cool medal to hang somewhere visible.
- At some point, it became too late to back out without shame.

## Marathon Day: A Timeline

An emotional rollercoaster, told chronologically:

1. Woke up way too early, full of hope.
2. Felt AMAZING for the first 10 km (suspicious).
3. Started doing mental math about pace.
4. Realized a marathon is actually very long.
5. Entered a dark negotiation phase with my legs.
6. Saw the finish line.
7. Finished in **less than 4 hours** like an absolute legend.

## Things I Learned

The marathon taught me many life lessons, including but not limited to:

- Training plans are not “suggestions.”
- Fueling is important and gels are… an experience.
- Your body can do insane things if your brain doesn’t quit.
- The crowd yelling your name gives +10 speed.
- I am stronger than I thought (and also very tired).

## Gear & Tech I Trusted With My Life

- Expensive running shoes (worth it, zero regrets).
- A watch that knew my suffering down to the second.
- Sunglasses big enough to block out doubt.
- Way too many gels.
- Hope.

## Final Thoughts

Running my first marathon was hard, emotional, exhausting, and completely worth it.  
Would I do it again?

…Ask me after my legs recover.

Until then, I’ll be casually reminding people that I ran a marathon in under 4 hours.
