# Why I Like Running

Running is one of those things I complain about _while_ doing it and then immediately miss once I stop.  
This page is a small tribute to sweating, questionable life choices, and endorphins.

## Why I Like Running

Here are the _very serious_ and _highly scientific_ reasons why running has my heart:

- It’s socially acceptable to wear big-ass glasses and _all_ kinds of tech wearables at the same time.
- It lets me buy expensive running shoes without guilt (this is called _self-care_).
- Problems feel smaller when I’m too tired to think about them.
- The post-run shower feels like a luxury spa experience.

## How I Got Into Running

Running wasn’t love at first step. It was more like a slow, awkward friendship.

1. I started running to “do something different.”
3. I survived my first 10-minute run.
4. I accidentally signed up for a race.
5. Stockholm syndrome kicked in.
6. Now I run voluntarily.

## Favorite Places to Run

Some places just make running better (or at least more tolerable):

- Parks with trees and shade
- Anywhere with a good view that distracts me from my legs

## Helpful & Fun Running Links

Here are some app I either use or pretend to use responsibly:

- [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) – proof that I actually ran
- [Runna](https://www.runna.com/) – how I do not injured myself

## Final Thoughts

Running isn’t always easy, fun, or graceful — but that’s kind of the point.  
It’s just me, the road, my thoughts, and the promise of snacks afterward.

_Now excuse me while I stretch and dramatically complain about my calves._

## Other Posts About Running

Because apparently running once wasn’t enough:

- [My First Marathon](/blog/my-first-marathon) — featuring questionable decisions, emotional damage, and a finish time under 4 hours.
- [The Delusion: Running the World Marathon Majors](/blog/the-delusion-world-majors) — where I confidently plan a sub-3 marathon despite all available evidence.
