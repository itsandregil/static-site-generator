And yes — I finished in <b>under 4 hours</b>, which I will mention casually whenever possible.</p><p><img src="/images/the-marathon.jpg" alt="Marathon runners on the road"></img></p><h2>Why I Signed Up for a Marathon</h2><p>Several factors contributed to this decision, none of them rational:</p><ul><li>I said “sure” before fully understanding the distance.</li><li>I thought <i>“how hard can it be?”</i> (famous last words).</li><li>Peer pressure, but like… sporty peer pressure.</li><li>I wanted a cool medal to hang somewhere visible.</li><li>At some point, it became too late to back out without shame.</li></ul><h2>Marathon Day: A Timeline</h2><p>An emotional rollercoaster, told chronologically:</p><ol><li>Woke up way too early, full of hope.</li><li>Felt AMAZING for the first 10 km (suspicious).</li><li>Started doing mental math about pace.</li><li>Realized a marathon is actually very long.</li><li>Entered a dark negotiation phase with my legs.</li><li>Saw the finish line.</li><li>Finished in <b>less than 4 hours</b> like an absolute legend.</li></ol><h2>Things I Learned</h2><p>The marathon taught me many life lessons, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Training plans are not “suggestions.”</li><li>Fueling is important and gels are… an experience.</li><li>Your body can do insane things if your brain doesn’t quit.</li><li>The crowd yelling your name gives +10 speed.</li><li>I am stronger than I thought (and also very tired).</li></ul><h2>Gear & Tech I Trusted With My Life</h2><ul><li>Expensive running shoes (worth it, zero regrets).</li><li>A watch that knew my suffering down to the second.</li><li>Sunglasses big enough to block out doubt.</li><li>Way too many gels.</li><li>Hope.</li></ul><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Running my first marathon was hard, emotional, exhausting, and completely worth it. Would I do it again?</p><p>…Ask me after my legs recover.</p><p>Until then, I’ll be casually reminding people that I ran a marathon in under 4 hours.</p></div></article>
